### This project is created for my personal website.

#### To push a commit to Heroku, just run these commands:
1. `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
2. `git push heroku master`.
3. Optionally, you must login to heroku in order to add commits to Heroku. 
So first, you need heroku installed (verify by typing `heroku -v`) then you type `heroku login` and add your credentials.
